# WebXR Molecule Viewer - Project Handover

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a WebXR application designed for immersive molecular visualization. The primary goal is to create a virtual reality environment where users can load, inspect, and manipulate 3D models of molecules (from PDB files) in a confined virtual space.

**Core Aims:**
- **Immersive Experience:** Provide a sense of presence and scale by allowing users to walk around and view molecules in a room-scale VR environment.
- **Intuitive Interaction:** Offer easy-to-use controls for both desktop (mouse and keyboard) and VR (controllers).
- **Educational Tool:** Serve as a platform for students and researchers to study molecular structures in a more engaging way than traditional 2D viewers.
- **Advanced Visualization:** Feature high-quality rendering, including a stylized pedestal with a pulsating glow effect to showcase the molecule.

## 2. Development History & Challenges

The development process has been challenging, marked by significant hurdles that have slowed progress. Understanding this history is crucial for any future developer.

**Key Challenges Faced:**

1.  **The Pedestal Shader:**
    *   **Initial Goal:** A beveled pedestal with a custom GLSL shader to create a pulsating red glow.
    *   **Problem:** The pedestal would frequently disappear without any console errors. This was eventually traced to a silent GPU-side shader compilation failure. The complexity of the shader, combined with the `onBeforeCompile` modifications in Three.js, made it extremely difficult to debug.
    *   **Current Status:** The complex geometry and custom shader have been replaced with a simple `CylinderGeometry` and a basic material. This was done to stabilize the application. The original shader code is still present in `Pedestal.ts` but is disabled.

2.  **The Radial Menu:**
    *   **Goal:** A fully functional, in-world radial menu for accessing all major application features.
    *   **Problem:** This has been the most persistent and frustrating issue. The menu has gone through several states of being broken:
        *   Not appearing at all (due to its `update` method not being called).
        *   Appearing but not being selectable (due to event listener conflicts with the main canvas).
        *   Appearing and being selectable, but with non-functional buttons.
    *   **Current Status:** The menu is visible and items can be hovered over and clicked. However, the actions associated with the buttons (e.g., `close`, `toggle panels`) are not firing. **This is the single most critical bug to fix.**

3.  **Controls:**
    *   **Problem:** WASD walk controls stopped working at one point because the call to `controls.processKeyboardInput()` was accidentally removed from the main animation loop.
    *   **Current Status:** This has been fixed. The transition between orbit and walk controls is functional.

## 3. Technical Deep-Dive & Good-to-Knows

- **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Three.js, Webpack.
- **Main Application Logic:** `ConfinedSpaceXR.ts` is the central class that orchestrates everything: scene setup, rendering, UI management, and the animation loop.
- **UI Components:** The UI is modular. `RadialMenu.ts` handles the menu itself, while `SettingsPanel.ts`, `HelpPanel.ts`, and `VisualizationPanel.ts` manage their respective HTML panels.
- **The `update()` Pattern:** Several components have their own `update(delta)` method (e.g., `RadialMenu`) which must be called from the main `animate` loop in `ConfinedSpaceXR.ts` to function correctly.
- **The Current Bug:** The radial menu buttons do not work. The actions are defined correctly in `setupRadialMenu` inside `ConfinedSpaceXR.ts`. The `onClick` method in `RadialMenu.ts` correctly identifies the clicked item and finds the associated action. The fact that the action still doesn't execute suggests a subtle bug, possibly related to the `this` context or the way the UI panels are managed and disable the menu.

## 4. The Way Forward: A Phased Approach

To avoid the pitfalls of the past, development should proceed in clear, sequential phases. Do not move to the next phase until the current one is complete and stable.

### Phase 1: Stabilization (Immediate Priority)

**Goal:** Achieve a rock-solid, bug-free foundation.

1.  **FIX THE RADIAL MENU:** This is the top priority. The application is unusable without it. Investigate why the actions defined in `setupRadialMenu` are not executing when called from `RadialMenu.ts`'s `onClick` method. Check the `this` context and how the `helpPanel`, `settingsPanel`, etc. are being referenced.
2.  **Verify All UI Panels:** Once the menu works, systematically test toggling each panel. Ensure they appear and disappear correctly and that the menu becomes disabled/enabled as expected (`updateUIMode` method).
3.  **Confirm Controls:** Re-verify that WASD and Orbit controls work flawlessly and that the `T` key correctly toggles between them.

### Phase 2: Core Functionality

**Goal:** Implement the application's primary features.

1.  **Implement PDB Loading:** Replace the placeholder molecule. Create the UI panel that allows users to input a PDB ID or upload a file. Use a library like `mol*` or a custom parser to load the data and generate the 3D model.
2.  **Implement Molecule Visualizations:** Connect the `VisualizationPanel` to the `Molecule` class to allow changing the model's appearance (e.g., ball and stick, space-filling, ribbon).

### Phase 3: Advanced Visuals & Polish

**Goal:** Enhance the user experience with advanced graphics. **This should only be attempted after Phase 1 and 2 are complete.**

1.  **Re-introduce Pedestal Geometry:** Swap the simple cylinder for the original `LatheGeometry` to create the beveled shape. Confirm it renders correctly.
2.  **Debug the Pulsating Shader:** This is the final, most delicate step. Re-introduce the custom GLSL shader code from `Pedestal.ts` line-by-line. Use the browser's developer tools to monitor for WebGL errors. Isolate the exact line that causes the compilation to fail.
3.  **Refine the Environment:** Adjust the fog, lighting, and floor grid to create a more immersive and aesthetically pleasing scene.

### Phase 4: VR Interaction & Refinement

**Goal:** Polish the VR-specific experience.

1.  **Implement Controller Interactions:** Add logic for using VR controllers to directly interact with the molecule (e.g., grab-to-rotate, grab-to-move).
2.  **Add Haptic Feedback:** Use the controller's vibration motors to provide feedback for menu selections and interactions.
